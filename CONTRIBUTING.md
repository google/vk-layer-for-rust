## Contribution process

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)
for this purpose.

### Format the code

#### Rust

Nightly features in `rustfmt` is used, so run `cargo +nightly fmt` to format the entire project.

#### Python

Python scripts are used to generate some Rust source files. Use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable) to format python code:

```bash
$ python -m black .
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
4 files left unchanged.
```

### Regenerate code

1. Install LLVM and set up the environment variable required by `bindgen`: [link](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html), because `bindgen` is used in the codegen process.

2. Make sure python newer than 3.9 is installed.

3. Run the following command:

```bash
cargo xtask codegen
```

The codegen scripts will automatically format the generated file, so no need to manually format the project after running codegen.

[cargo xtask pattern](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask) is used to automate the code generation process.

Files are generated in different mechanism:

* `vulkan-layer/src/bindings/generated/vk_layer_bindings.rs`

  This file is generated from `vk_layer.h` in the `Vulkan-Headers` dependency by using `bindgen`.

* `vulkan-layer/src/generated/{layer_trait,global_simple_intercept}.rs`

  These 2 files are generated through the `scritps/vulkan_layer_genvk.py`. This script utilizes the `OutputGenerator` class defined in the `generator.py` from the Vulkan registry repo.

### Test

`cargo-nextest` is the recommended way to run the test.  Run `cargo nextest run` to run all tests. This is how CI runs the tests.

`cargo test` is also supported. However, `cargo +nightly test -Z panic-abort-tests` is nicer because the library is supposed to be built with `panic="abort"`.

[`cargo-llvm-cov`](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov) [with `cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/book/test-coverage.html#llvm-cov) is used to generate the code coverage info. To generate the `lcov` coverage file locally under `target/lcov.info`, run `cargo llvm-cov nextest --lcov --output-path target/lcov.info`.
